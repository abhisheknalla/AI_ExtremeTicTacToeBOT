# AI_ExtremeTicTacToeBO

An Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe Bot for a 4 by 4 board which is further subdivided into 4 by 4 blocks using Artificial Intelligence. It uses minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to decide its move. Also designed heuristic function to enable it to choose a more optimal move than a lesser optimal one.
[Here](https://github.com/abhisheknalla/AI_ExtremeTicTacToeBOT/blob/master/ETTT.pdf) is a description of the world.

Need to call the Team31 class from the team31 file to play against another bot(or random player) in the simulator.


The Bot uses Minimax and AlphaBeta Pruning along with Heuristic evaluation functions to enhance its performance.
